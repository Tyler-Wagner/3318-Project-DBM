TODO:
Rules for TODO:
1) After your portion of the code is finished, change the modified date and who it was modified by
2) Mark the task is done in todo
3) if you need to update this file to add a task then do it, but make sure some framework for adding on is there

GENERAL:
Add database logic to the DatabasePackage
Add the logic needed in the WindowPackage

WindowPackage:
Add finishing logic for previous searches
    -Adding a way to pull the previous searches and get the info

Add a new window for the searched product
Add logic for createUser window (just import the shit needed from the JFrame)
MAYBE ADD A CLASS THAT HAS EVERYTHING FOR CREATING NEEDED WINDOWS. (Essentially a generic, thanks burris)
